# Welcome to EEHS Hack Clucb

Hi, I'm Freddie and this is GitHub, if you are a member reading this it may be your first time usign Github, if you are reading this otherwise then you already know what GitHub is.

This Org is how we will manage code as a club. We haven't full worked out how it will work but learning along the way is the best way!

Bye for now...
